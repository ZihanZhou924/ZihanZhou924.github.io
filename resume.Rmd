## Research Experience

**Research Assistant**, Institute of Software, Fudan University — *Sep 2024–present*  
*Research on key anti-money laundering technologies using a blockchain-based service network.*  
- Investigated and extracted the blockchain characteristics of financial transactions.  
- Constructed an RNN classification model based on neural network knowledge; trained the RNN model using time-series features from the Elliptic++ Database.  
- Implemented the RNN model and successfully classified 95% of money laundering cases using transaction information; cross-validation and variance analysis indicated the RNN’s stability and effectiveness.

**Research Assistant**, Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, Zhengzhou University — *Jun 2024–Sep 2024*  
*“Single-machine scheduling for minimizing total weighted completion time of tardy jobs,” published in the European Journal of Operational Research.*  
- Analyzed computational complexity of single-machine scheduling, considering restrictions on weights, due dates, or processing time using R.  
- Proved scheduling problem “1|p_j=p|∑ω_j (C_j×U_j)” solvable in O(n³) time.  
- Developed a branch-and-bound algorithm to create optimal schedules, arranging early jobs in EDD order and tardy jobs in SPT order.
